## [Introduction](#introduction)
In this project, I utilize Python to analayze the stats of all Pokemon in Generations 1 - 8, and calculate some interesting statistics based on a number of relevant factors that contribute to 'stength' in game. 

With these stats we can use the data to answer questions such as:
- **Does a Pokemon's Type determine it's stats?: HP, Attack, Defense, etc.?**
- **What is the most important stat for predicting other stats? i.e. which stats have a high correlation?**
- **What attributes classify a Pokemon as 'Legendary'?**

In the following sections, I will walk through my process of extracting and analyzing the information using ```pandas```, creating some visualizations and modeling using ```scikit-learn```.

## [Exploratory Analysis](#exploratory)
Start by importing all the necessary packages into Python:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Viz
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 
import plotly.express as px

sns.set_style('whitegrid')
%matplotlib inline

# Import for Linear Regression
import sklearn
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
```

Read Data File:
```python
df = pd.read_excel("pokemon.xlsx")
```
Create a separate dataframe including just the necessary stats:
```python
df_stats = df[["Name","HP","Attack","Defense","SP_Attack","SP_Defense","Speed"]]
```
Although each stat is important in it's own right, the total value of all stats is what determines the category of a pokemon, therefore let's concatenate a column into the ```df``` that sums up the total values:
```python
df['total'] = df.HP + df.Attack + df.Defense + df.SP_Attack + df.SP_Defense + df.Speed
```

Now let's view the range of total stats by each generation:
```python
#palette: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html?highlight=color
plt.figure(figsize=(13,10), dpi=80)
sns.violinplot(x='Gen', y='total', data=df, scale='width', inner='quartile', palette='Set2') 
plt.title('Violin Plot of Total Stats by Generation', fontsize=22)
plt.show()
```
![2df65225-732a-4581-af16-46cbaf14b931](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153741822-44e70858-0ce7-436c-b649-5c172f4ce08f.png)

In the above violinplot we can see that each generation has quite a different range of total stats with Gens IV, VII, & VIII having the longest range, while Gen V had a relatively tight range of stats. All Generations from IV onwards had higher medians than the first 3 generations. 

Looking at individual stats, **Speed** is one of (if not THE) most important stat in competitive play, so let's examine which generations had the best overall speed stats.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(13,10), dpi=80)
sns.violinplot(x='Gen', y='Speed', data=df, scale='width', inner='quartile', palette='Set2')

plt.title('Violin Plot of Total Stats by Generation', fontsize=22)
plt.show()
```
![speed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153742342-dfcc2c47-541f-44f2-8998-a04a83ebe10d.png)

Here we can clearly see Generation VIII has some of the fastest pokemon ever seen in games. Let's create a function to return the top 10 fastest pokemon in Gen VIII and their respective speed stat values:

```python
def top_n(df, category, n):
    return (df.loc[df['Gen'] == 'VIII'].sort_values(category, ascending=False)[['Name','Gen',category]].head(n))
```
```python
print('Top 10 Pokemon Speed')
top_n(df, 'Speed', 10)
```
<img width="238" alt="speed_gen8" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153742615-a6d3e5a6-12d6-45de-bef5-4377deef61e7.png">

Those are definitely some fast pokemon!

Let's now see if we can get any indication of whether a particular pokemon's type has an advantage over others in total stats.

```python
types_color_dict = {
    'grass':'#8ED752', 'fire':'#F95643', 'water':'#53AFFE', 'bug':"#C3D221", 'normal':"#BBBDAF", \
    'poison': "#AD5CA2", 'electric':"#F8E64E", 'ground':"#F0CA42", 'fairy':"#F9AEFE", \
    'fighting':"#A35449", 'psychic':"#FB61B4", 'rock':"#CDBD72", 'ghost':"#7673DA", \
    'ice':"#66EBFF", 'dragon':"#8B76FF", 'dark':"#1A1A1A", 'steel':"#C3C1D7", 'flying':"#75A4F9" }

plt.figure(figsize=(15,12), dpi=80)
sns.violinplot(x='Primary', y='total', data=df, scale='width', inner='quartile', palette=types_color_dict)

plt.title('Violin Plot of Total Stats by Type', fontsize=20)
plt.show()
```
![total_type_stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153742776-8ff03580-972e-4b37-a9cb-daed42e09163.png)

The **dragon type** definitely has quite a high upper interquartile range compared to other types. Meanwhile water & fairy types seem to have quite a large variance in total stats. 

Let's see what the most common type of pokemon is:
```python
types_color_dict = {
    'grass':'#8ED752', 'fire':'#F95643', 'water':'#53AFFE', 'bug':"#C3D221", 'normal':"#BBBDAF", \
    'poison': "#AD5CA2", 'electric':"#F8E64E", 'ground':"#F0CA42", 'fairy':"#F9AEFE", \
    'fighting':"#A35449", 'psychic':"#FB61B4", 'rock':"#CDBD72", 'ghost':"#7673DA", \
    'ice':"#66EBFF", 'dragon':"#8B76FF", 'dark':"#1A1A1A", 'steel':"#C3C1D7", 'flying':"#75A4F9" }


Type1 = pd.value_counts(df['Primary'])
sns.set()
dims = (11.7,8.27) #A4 dimensions
fig, ax=plt.subplots(figsize=dims)
BarT = sns.barplot(x=Type1.index, y=Type1, data=df, palette=types_color_dict, ax=ax)
BarT.set_xticklabels(BarT.get_xticklabels(), rotation= 90, fontsize=12)
BarT.set(ylabel = 'Freq')
BarT.set_title('Distribution of Primary Pokemon Types')
FigBar = BarT.get_figure()
```
![type_distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153743003-888b9e1b-4353-4cb8-b07f-bfd93e513c29.png)

We can see that the water and normal type pokemon are the most frequently appearing 'primary' types in the game. Interesting to see Flying types as lowest however it makes sense when we only look at primary types as majority of pokemon that are dual types with Flying usually have flying as their 'secondary' type. Meaning, a Pokemon is usually never "Flying/Normal", it's always "Normal/Flying" for example. 

Let's see how many pokemon are mono types vs dual-types so we can get a better sense of whether primary is sufficient.

```python
labels = ['Mono type pokemon', 'Dual type pokemon']
sizes = [monotype, dualtype]
colors = ['lightskyblue', 'lightcoral']

patches, texts, _ = plt.pie(sizes, colors=colors, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90, explode=(0,0.1))
plt.legend(patches, labels, loc="best")
plt.axis('equal')
plt.title('Dual-Type Ratio', fontsize=12)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![mono_dual](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153743106-853f1990-c3d3-4cfb-8db7-dd119929d39c.png)

**Looks like there's actually more dual types than mono-types!**

Aside from types, there are also 5 categories of pokemon: Regular, Pseudo-Legendary, Sub-Legendary, Legendary and Mythical. (There are of course also pre-evolutions, final evolutions, mega-evolutions etc.. but for the purposes of this analysis we will just bundle those together under 'regular' along with Pseudo-Legendary which are regular pokemon that have generally higher stats of 600 total. 
As for Sub Legendaries, Legendaries and Mythical - these pokemon typically exhibit **2 types of traits**: 
1. Rarity: There is usually only 1 of those pokemon available in every game (some may not even be obtainable in certain games)
2. Stats: These pokemon generally have much higher stats than the average 'regular' pokemon.

Let's create a diverging bar to determine the rate at which legendary pokemon appear in each generation:
```python
#Sub-Legendary, Legendary or Mythical:
df.loc[df["is_sllm"]==False,"sllmid"] = 0
df.loc[df["is_sllm"]==True,"sllmid"] = 1

# calculate proportion of SL, L, M #
sllm_ratio = df.groupby("Gen").mean()["sllmid"]
sllm_ratio.round(4)*100
```

```python
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
df_plot = pd.DataFrame(columns={"Gen","Rate","colors"})
x = sllm_ratio.values
df_plot["Gen"] = sllm_ratio.index
df_plot['Rate'] = (x - x.mean())/x.std()
df_plot['colors'] = ['red' if x < 0 else 'green' for x in df_plot['Rate']]
df_plot.sort_values('Rate', inplace=True)
df_plot.reset_index(inplace=True)

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))
plt.hlines(
    y=df_plot.index, xmin=0, xmax=df_plot.Rate,
    color=df_plot.colors,
    alpha=.4,
    linewidth=5)

plt.gca().set(xlabel='Rate', ylabel='Gen')
plt.yticks(df_plot.index, df_plot.Gen, fontsize=12)
plt.title('Diverging Bars of SubL, Legendary & Mythical Rate', fontdict={'size':20})
plt.show()
```

![sub, legend,myth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153743612-15eb0d03-0606-4f18-9bcf-9215b963f79e.png)

Seems like Gen 7's **Alola** region has a huge volume of these 'legendaries & mythical' pokemon, which after digging further into it makes perfect sense given the introduction of a plethora of legendaries called **'ultra beasts'** which were only ever introduced in that generation.

## [Correlations & Descriptive Statistics](#descriptive)
Let's move to explore some correlations between stats.

```python
#Correlation
Base_stats = ['Primary','Secondary','Classification','%Male','%Female',
              'Height','Weight','Capture_Rate','Base_Steps','HP','Attack','Defense',
              'SP_Attack','SP_Defense','Speed','is_sllm']

df_BS = df[Base_stats]
df_BS.head()
```
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14,12))

heatmap = sns.heatmap(df_BS.corr(), vmin=-1,vmax=1, annot=True, cmap='Blues')

heatmap.set_title('Correlation Base Stats Heatmap', fontdict={'fontsize':15}, pad=12)
plt.show()
```

```python

Looking at the summary statistics, we can see that the assumption about the variance and skewness of both plots was correct. The ‚Äòstd‚Äô metric of the Attack is less than Defense, meaning that Defense statistics are more spread. Similarly, the Sp.Atk ‚Äòstd‚Äô is larger than that of the Sp.Def. Skewness is determined by the positions of the median (50%) and the mean. Since in all instances (Attack, Defense, Sp.Attack and Sp.Defense) the mean is greater than the median, it is emphasised that the distribution is right-skewed (positively skewed).

# [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](#pca)
Let's take a look at PCA analysis and plot Pokemon in a two-dimensional plane using the first and second principal components.
PCA is a type of multivariate analysis method that is often used as a dimensionality reduction method and sometimes regarded as a type of **unsupervised ML**, revealing the structure of the data itself. 

In this data, the characteristics of all Pokemon total stats are represented by **6 types** of **"observed variables"** (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6). 
(As explained earlier - HP, Attack, Defense, SP Attack, SP Defense & Speed) - these 6 variables are used as explanatory variables. 
On the other hand, the synthetic variable synthesized by PCA is called "principal component score" and is given by a linear combination as shown in the following equation: 

yPC1 = a1,1 x1 + a1,2 x2 + a1,3 x3 + a1,4 x4 + a1,5 x5 + a1,6 x6

In principal component analysis, the larger the ```eigenvalue``` (= variance of the principal component score), **the more important the principal component score is**.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA()
pca.fit(df.iloc[:, 13:18])
feature = pca.transform(df.iloc[:, 13:18])
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))
plt.scatter(feature[:, 0], feature[:, 1], alpha=0.8)
plt.xlabel('PC1')
plt.ylabel('PC2')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
![PCA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153744763-f3c32c09-0534-4c58-809f-e0212e10ca05.png)

```python
plt.gca().get_xaxis().set_major_locator(ticker.MaxNLocator(integer=True))
plt.plot([0] + list( np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)), "-o")
plt.xlabel("Number of Components")
plt.ylabel("CCR")
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
![components](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153744830-3f86c909-c3de-4ff1-bbae-c0c32cd90f53.png)
    
Let's see if we can determine what makes a pokemon **'LEGENDARY'**

```python
pca = PCA()
pca.fit(df.iloc[:, 13:18])
feature = pca.transform(df.iloc[:, 13:18])
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))
for binary in [True, False]:
    plt.scatter(feature[df['is_sllm'] == binary, 0], feature[df['is_sllm'] == binary, 1], alpha=0.8, label=binary)
plt.xlabel('PC1')
plt.ylabel('PC2')
plt.legend(loc = 'best')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
![pca_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153744885-42ed952b-05de-4f8a-a658-b6b64ba1d29d.png)

Although it's not 'perfect' we can clearly see that when the first principal component (PC1) reaches 50, we start to see a significantly higher concentration of legendary pokemon. Now, let's illustrate how much PC1 actually contributes to the explanatory variable (parameter) with a loading plot.

![components_stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153745198-40a1fa84-cb1a-4118-a0d1-68ed7a50bb84.png)

Assuming that PC1 is actually a strong indicator of whether or not a pokemon is classified as legendary, sub-legendary or mythical, it seems like Special Attack is of of the strongest indicators out of all stats (followed by Physical Attack)

In PCA, we synthesized the "principal component" yPC1 which is a linear combination of the weight matrix (eigenvector) a for the explanatory variables. Here, define as many principal components as there are explanatory variables.
    
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import FactorAnalysis
fa = FactorAnalysis(n_components=2, max_iter=500)
factors = fa.fit_transform(df.iloc[:, 13:18])
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))
for binary in [True, False]:
    plt.scatter(factors[df['is_sllm'] == binary, 0], factors[df['is_sllm'] == binary, 1], alpha=0.8, label=binary)
plt.xlabel("Factor 1")
plt.ylabel("Factor 2")
plt.legend(loc = 'best')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
![pca_color2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153745352-7366b274-3ff8-4bbc-bd4d-327bec30f3eb.png)

In this instance, the determining factor of a 'legendary' is whether or not the sum of factor 1 and factor 2 exceeds a certain level, but it seems that it is slightly biased toward the larger factor 2. So which parameters do factor 2 and factor 1 allude to?

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
for x, y, name in zip(fa.components_[0], fa.components_[1], df.columns[13:18]):
    plt.text(x, y, name)
plt.scatter(fa.components_[0], fa.components_[1])
plt.grid()
plt.xlabel("Factor 1")
plt.ylabel("Factor 2")
plt.show()
```
![component_stats(factor2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153745455-4f348603-8330-4d05-a467-261ebc35c02c.png)

Factor 1 highest value = "Defense"
Factor 2 highest value = "Special Attack" 

Let's create some charts!
I wanted to see which pokemon exhibit similar characteristics to each other so I created a cluster of IDs to group together pokemon with similar attributes and distribution of stats:

```python
clusterIDs = get_cluster_by_number(result1, 50)
print(clusterIDs)
```
<img width="1364" alt="cluster_ids" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153746879-35524b22-aa1a-46a0-b807-9712d474bda0.png">

```python
plt.hist(clusterIDs, bins=50)
plt.show()
```
![histo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153746942-f5986c3e-0267-413d-80bc-b744e84b46cd.png)

Here we've created 50 bins so there will be 50 different clusters of pokemon. That's quite a large number of charts to display so I'll just display several so you get the idea.

![cluster4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38530617/153747188-3ea042df-70b5-4972-bf44-4e3b9178be93.png)

Some pokemon exhibit lots of traits similar to each other while others (like Regieleki) stand out due to their incredible speed as we saw earlier in the highest speed stat in **Gen VIII**.
    
# [Cross Validation & Regression Analysis](#cv-ra)
Since we saw earlier that Special Attack is a huge contributing factor to determining whether a pokemon is classified as 'legendary', let's use the rest of the stats to see if we can predict Special Attack and which stats are best contributors for determining this stat.
    
```python
X = df.iloc[:, 13:18]
y = df['total']
```
    
```python
from sklearn import linear_model
regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(X, y)

print("Regression Coefficient= ", regr.coef_)
print("Intercept= ", regr.intercept_)
print("Coefficient of Determination= ", regr.score(X, y))
```

```python
df.columns[[12, 13, 14, 16, 17]]
X = df.iloc[:, [12, 13, 14, 16, 17]]
y = df['SP_Attack']

### Cross Validation
In machine learning, in order to evaluate performance, known data is divided into ```training``` and ```test``` data. Training (learning) is performed using training data to build a prediction model, and performance evaluation is based on how accurately the test data that was not used to build the prediction model can be predicted.

Training data (60% of all data)
X_train: Explanatory variables for training data
y_train: Objective variable for training data
Test data (40% of all data)
X_test: Explanatory variable for test data
y_test: Objective variable for test data
We aim to learn the relationship between X_train and y_train and predict y_test from X_test. If the training data seems to show good performance, but the test data not used for training has poor performance, the model is said to be "overfitted".
    
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.4)
```
```
Regression Coefficient=  [ 0.15598049  0.09796333 -0.11115187  0.47986509  0.32513351]
Intercept=  5.4684249031776915
Coefficient of Determination(train)=  0.39594357153305826
Coefficient of Determination(test)=  0.38127048972638855
```
These values change with each calculation because the division into training data and test data is based on random pulls.
If you want to calculate a regression equation, you can standardize the explanatory variables and objective variables and then regressing, then find the "standard regression coefficient", which is an index determining the value. 

```python
Xs = X.apply(lambda x: (x-x.mean())/x.std(), axis=0)
ys = list(pd.DataFrame(y).apply(lambda x: (x-x.mean())/x.std()).values.reshape(len(y),))
```
```python
from sklearn import linear_model
regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()

regr.fit(Xs, ys)

print("Regression Coefficient= ", regr.coef_)
print("Intercept= ", regr.intercept_)
print("Coefficient of Determination= ", regr.score(Xs, ys))
```

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)
It seems that Special Defense & Speed are the best determinators in predicting "Special Attack". This makes perfect sense as usually a High Special Attacking pokemon is more 'special' focused and typically has less physical bulk. Additionally because of this, if these pokemon get hit by a physical move that's strong enough they could 1HKO them which is why Speed also plays a huge roll. The faster you are the higher the chance that you will attack first and survive. (Pretty basic for most Pokemon players >.>) 

Overall this was a way of exploring different pokemon traits and taking into account multiple factors. There's plenty more we can look into such as 'strengths', 'weaknesses' etc..which I may do at some point, but I hope you all enjoyed this, and thanks for reading all the way through!
